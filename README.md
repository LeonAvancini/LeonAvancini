### Hi there 👋
<!--
My preferred role is as Front-end developer. I've been working with React.js over the last two years and I have made some features in backend using Node.Js.
I want to work in a team whose members cooperate and share knowledge.
I’m leaving my current job to keep growing on what I am doing, I aspire to be a full-stack developer.

In the last year I have made my first entire App for a client (Front-end). I have learnt a lot and overcame some step-backs. I'm truly happy because the app is in production and that was my objective.
I like to reach my objectives by creating a step by step plan and by following good practices and learning others by making an scalable code.
I'm always trying to learn from my teammates skills because I can acquire new ones. I try to teach everything I know whenever I see an opportunity too.
